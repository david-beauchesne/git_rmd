# Ana's section


In this section we can learn about bill length differences between our three different penguin species. 



To start, we will first take a look at this plot showing bill length per penguin species:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(penguins$species, y = penguins$bill_length_mm, pch = 20, col = '#32c4c4',
     main = 'Bill length for each penguin species',
     xlab = 'Penguin species', ylab = 'Bill length (mm)')
```
